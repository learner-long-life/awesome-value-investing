# Awesome Value Investing [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) [![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/learner-long-life/awesome-value-investing/)

A curated list of resources for learning value investing,
compounding wealth
sustainably, and finding great businesses.

"Value and growth are joined at the hip. Growth may be a negligible consideration or a major factor in estimating a business's future prospects. We consider the term 'value investing' to be redundant. What else is investing other than the search for value?" [--Warren Buffett](https://youtu.be/bkGj4wPvI7g)

Someday, we won't have to write whole books about the difference between investing and speculation. Until then... there's Awesome Value Investing.
