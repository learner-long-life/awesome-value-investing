## Why Celebrate Investing

I'm throwing this in here because I know for some of you "investing" is a trigger word,
practiced in that greatest den of iniquity, The Stock Market. At best, you think it's a 
casino, at worst, you think it is ravaging the earth, and in either case, rigged to 
benefit the 1% at the expense of the other 99%. You are surprised that someone who 
claims to value humanity, biodiversity, who believes scientific evidence about climate 
change, who is passionate about affordable housing, is celebrating investing and has 
chosen it as a vehicle for personal development and social change.

### Memetics

Gamestop became world-famous during the pandemic due to a coordinated buying rally 
on the subreddit [/r/WallStreetBets], presumably as a short squeeze against 
large institutional investors but also manifesting the Ponzi scheme that has 
the potential to be embedded in any group investment activity. It was the first of the 
meme stocks, to be followed by the movie theater chain AMC, the nostalgic food storage containers
by Tupperware, and more. They are highly unstable and not generally regarded as reflecting
reality: used video game cartridges did not suddenly become a successful industry 
just because the stock price increased 900% in one year. However, memes can have a seed of 
truth. 

A lesser known of meme stocks are those when investors confuse names or companies.
After Elon Musk tweeted in January 2021 recommending his followers "use Signal" the 
encrypted text messaging service, [the stock for the company Signal Advance went up 438$
instead](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/signal-advance-jumps-another-438percent-after-elon-musk-fueled-buying-frenzy.html). Perhaps it is just Elon's reality distortion field, but there 
are probably investors who buy shares of Tesla thinking they are investing in SpaceX,
The Boring Company, or any of Elon's other companies, because he is the CEO of all of them.

### Oversimplifying a Whole Industry: Banking

In the same way, banks and investors are often vilified in movies and popular media.
Scrooge is a cold-hearted moneylender in Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The evil banker in 
It's a Wonderful Life is threatening to foreclose on a bunch of orphans. And there are plenty 
of examples of banks behaving badly in real life. Wells Fargo was embroiled in a scandal where 
employees created fake customer accounts in order to collect bonuses. Their largest shareholder
in the past, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, while declining to criticize Wells Fargo and 
its CEO directly, is now largely divested from the company. All major banks during the
Global Financial Crisis accepted a government bailout of hundreds of millions to billions of dollars,
with top executives still collecting large bonuses, at a time when many ordinary citizens were 
suffering layoffs.

However, just as small businesses add 2/3 of all new jobs in the last 25 years
(https://advocacy.sba.gov/2022/04/26/small-business-facts-small-business-job-creation/),
the majority of bank deposits are held at regional or small banks, other than the big 
7 ()
(https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/largest-banks-us-list/)
    JPMorgan Chase – $3.31 Trillion.
    Bank of America – $2.41 Trillion.
    Citigroup – $1.714 Trillion.
    Wells Fargo & Co. – $1.712 Trillion.
    U.S. Bancorp – $591.21 Billion.
    PNC Financial Services – $553.39 Billion.
    Truist Financial Corporation – $534.19 Billion.
    Goldman Sachs – $513.91 Billion.

Some regional banks, either through risky behavior and bad accounting, insufficient 
superivision from the government, modern technology and the same flighty social coordination 
allowing flash withdrawals, suffered collapse in March 2023, notably Silicon Valley Bank,
where all the above factors were in play, and later First Republic.

However, there are many regional banks that lend to local businesses and make the 
determination every day of worthwhile credit risks to grow local communities, fund 
new buildings and infrastructure, and providing both physical safety and security 
to citizens who previously put their cash under their mattresses.

The Bank of America started as a bank for Italian Americans in California during the 
1920s, when they were discriminated against by other banks. It was brought into being by 
the sheer energy and skill of mostly one man, Giannini, and his community and family
in San Francisco, and was instrumental in rebuilding that community after a great fire.
Due to their focus on keeping large reserves, customer service, and serving the community, 
The "Bank of Italy" has grown into the BoA of today.

No business grows large and stays large for long periods of time without serving more people 
than most of its competitors. The Enrons, the Long Term Capital Managements, Bear Stearns, 
Lehman Brothers, the Bernie Madoffs and Jeffrey Epsteins, all fall eventually,
and usually only last as long as they do through willful ignorance of their contemporaries.
As in any organization, there is waste, corruption, 
people behaving badly, but very few are unalloyed Camelots, shining cities on a hill without 
blemish (Berkshire Hathaway comes to mind as the closest modern example, and there are many 
anti-capitalists who will find its inevitable faults as well). To dismiss wholesale an entire 
industry for the faults of their worst exemplars, picked cursorily from sensationalist 
headlines, without acknowledging the good they also do, and oftentimes in vast preponderance
in proportion to their ills, is, as Charlie Munger put it, "the height of immaturity."

### Oil and Oxy 

Vicky Hollub is not your typical oil executive. She knows that oil production is an industry
that contributes the most to carbon emissions and climate change, and she knows its time will 
come to an end, and is actively working .
